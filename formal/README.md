# Formal Verification Guide

The formal artifacts precede production implementation.

- `rocq/GraphQuotient.v` defines the exact SCC quotient contract and proves fiber totality and
  nonemptiness, quotient-edge witness equivalence, condensation acyclicity, bidirectional
  renaming preservation, permutation/duplicate/extensional enumeration invariance, and wavefront
  independence. It additionally proves exact $`5|V| + |E|`$ work for a complete canonical SCC
  trace, an auxiliary-heap bound of $`5|V|`$ slots, constant native control depth, the exact
  piecewise charge for radix workspace preparation and six-pass 11-bit canonicalization, and a
  phase-complete partition/condensation/wavefront upper bound of
  $`27|V| + 20|E| + 26{,}628`$. It also proves a complete reusable-workspace bound of
  $`9|V| + 2|E| + 2{,}048`$ slots, excluding returned values, plus a constant two-buffer flat-wave
  output with exactly $`|C| + |W| + 1`$ element slots. `Print Assumptions` output must report a
  closed global context for every acceptance theorem.
- `tla/IterativeGraphMachine.tla` models a finite explicit-frame traversal with completion and
  cancellation. TLC checks type, ownership, uniqueness, frame bounds, exact discovery/edge/frame
  work accounting, linear work, and exact completed-state work.
- `model/exhaustive_graphs.rs` enumerates all directed graphs through four vertices, validates
  canonical forward/reverse CSR, compares the iterative SCC model with independent transitive
  closure, checks every vertex permutation together with its induced condensation and ranks, and
  constructs flat wave offsets/members with exact work and constant-buffer checks, and runs a
  20,000-vertex small-stack lifecycle.
- `verus/flat_wave_refinement.rs` proves rank-fiber totality and disjointness, flat-wave storage
  linearity, exact schedule charging, unsigned 64-bit fit in the graph domain, and the uniform
  phase-complete pipeline bound.
- The `#[cfg(kani)]` harnesses in `src/radix.rs`, `src/control.rs`, and `src/condensation.rs`
  execute concrete production functions symbolically. They prove pair encoding round trips,
  radix-work arithmetic cannot overflow in the graph domain, work admission is fail-atomic, and
  the flat-wave buffers are sorted exact rank fibers for the bounded harness domain.

Run:

```bash
scripts/verify-formal.sh
```

The default command checks all five layers. Each layer runs in a transient systemd user scope with
`MemorySwapMax=0`, one Cargo build job, and an explicit resident-memory ceiling. Rocq, TLA+/TLC,
the exhaustive model, and Verus receive 4 GiB; Kani/CBMC receives 2 GiB. A cap hit is a failed
proof gate and must be addressed by reducing verifier state, not by silently increasing the cap.

The command writes transient evidence below `target/verification`. Record commands, versions,
result summaries, peak memory, and SHA-256 hashes in pgmcp before deleting those files.
